    "When the zero-tolerance policy that required families to be separated at the border was implemented, the only relevant number that could be obtained from the HHS was the total number of UAC. The reason for this being that once the families were split, children were considered UAC and processed the same as children who came without adults.\n",

    "The sharp decline at the end of May is due to this change in reporting. I assume this is because the media was more interested in children who were separated from their family. This would be logical -- it wasn't known at this point that the procedure for UAC who had not been separated from their families would soon be changing. The sharp increase in September is due to the media generally returning to a similar UAC metric (more on that).\n",

    "The executive order that Trump signed on June 20th to end family separation carried with it an extremely important caveat. It served as an excuse to dismantle something referred to as the Flores agreement, which was a set of rules that governed how both UAC and families with children could be treated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flores rules were primarily meant to guarantee children certain rights. Basic necessities, such as food, water, medical treatment, running water, etc. were to be provided. Additionally, they would be released and reunited with an adult as soon as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Courts also decided that these rights extend to children with families, and by extension the families themselves (since they were not to be separated). Families with children were to be released after twenty days. The Trump administration viewed this as a loophole that led to a \"catch and release\" immigration policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, doing away with Flores does several things to harm children that I'm focusing on. It removes rules on the treatment of children, so they can be kept in adult detention centers in worse conditions. It also removes the time constraints on how soon a release must happen, whether it be a UAC or a family with childrne. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Flores agreement was always meant to be superceded by a more thought-out legal framework. The only reason it has stuck around for so long is the solutions to it were hard and every attempt by previous administrations had to be rolled back. All it would take is a stroke of a pen and an alibi to remove these protections though. Not only that, since it was not rolling back established law, the framework could be replaced without entering the public record.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't known until later that in addition to removing the protectons provided by Flores, the detainment procedures were altered to be more strict on the adults who were accompanying children at the border. The purported reasoning was to fight human trafficking -- but it's difficult to see it as anything other than an excuse to separate families without calling it separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of UAC reported by the HHS are influenced by these policy changes. I have called the original post zero-tolerance policy for children UAC A in the plot below. This includes children who were unaccompanied by the Flores' definition, and children who were separated from their families.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under immense political pressure, the administration scrubbed through the pool of UAC A to discover which children had been separated from their parents under the new policy. Since no records of this were required and there was little transparency, there is not much reason to believe the numbers. Regardless, a number was produced. This shows up in the plot as separated children. This 'pool' of separated children was reported on for several months and their reunification has been recorded in the plot below from official HHS statements reported by the media.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the number of this pool of separated children was decreasing, the children of UAC who were not considered separated lost their legal protections. I have called this new group UAC B. UAC B continued to grow while the selected group of separated children were reunited with their families. It is important to note that UAC B continued to grow under this more strict policy on which child was unaccompanied. It seems quite likely that after the pool of separated children was made, many children joined UAC B who would have been considered separated prior to the new rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of children in the UAC B group was not reported on while separated children were being reported on. I have taken the liberty of linearly interpolating the end of UAC A reporting to the beginning of UAC B reporting, while subtracting out the number of separated children where that number is available. It's also worth noting that the period of June in the plot doesn't really make sense -- the three groups plotted below should never all be active at the same time. I haven't fixed it primarily because it's not public knowledge when exactly these policies were changed and for now I'll leave it as a sort of transition zone."

    "1/ The number of detained children being reported about fluctuated wildly over time. This is because the metrics the media has been interested in have changed with time due to changing immigration policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2/ When zero-tolerance policy was introduced in April, numbers reported were generally for all “unaccompanied alien children” (UAC) in custody. It had to be this way, once a child was separated they became unaccompanied. Prior, UAC status did not apply to children w/families\n",
    "\n",
    "3/ Reported numbers during late May (UAC including separated children): ~8000-10000\n",
    "\n",
    "4/ News articles at this time focused on children separated from their families, which is a number that could NOT be reported because it wasn’t split from UAC number. In early June, involved govt orgs supposedly did a scrub of UAC to find those which had been separated at the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "5/ Reported numbers during mid June (Separated children): ~2500\n",
    "\n",
    "6/ June 20th, under immense political pressure, that stupid orange guy signed an executive order to “keep” families together (in detention). The “compromise” through which this accomplished was the removal of something called the Flores agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "7/ Flores rules that both a family w/children and UAC must be released within 20 days. The WH viewed this as a loophole that led to “catch and release”, which they wanted to end. So what was traded was family separation vs. indefinite detention of literally all children.\n",
    "\n",
    "8/ In addition to limits on the length of detention, Flores rules ensured basic services for all UAC such as education, medical care, etc.\n",

    "11/ Reported numbers during early September (new definition of UAC, minus some children who might have been separated): ~12000\n",
    "\n",
    "12/ The rules determining whether an adult “accompanied” a child were changed significantly as well. For example, an aunt traveling with a child might now not be considered close enough, and the child would then be UAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "13/ Health and Human Services (HHS) who are responsible for UAC are now required to share information on child sponsors with ICE, where they vet the entire household for “criminality”. This concept of criminality includes being in the US illegally.\n",
